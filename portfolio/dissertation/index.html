                                <p class="mb-0 pt-2 text-white fst-italic">Abstract: Procedural generation is the process of generating data through the use of algorithms and is widely used within the video games industry as a way of automatically creating large amounts of content. During development, procedural generation is used to reduce the time required to create levels thus, allowing for more focus on the implementation of game mechanics. The benefit to producing content using this approach is that it allows for more randomness within levels which gives gameplay less predictability. The focus of this project will be on the generation of levels for use within a dungeon game. An investigation will be conducted into the techniques used in procedural dungeon generation and they will be evaluated. The techniques will be used to implement a system which will generate dungeon levels with rooms of varying sizes and tunnels interconnecting with them.</p>

                                    For the final year of university my dissertation focussed on the implementation of various algorithms to produce a dungeon generator. The generator uses Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree to decide how the dungeon rooms are connected together. The A* Search is used to control how the paths chosen by Prim's are drawn between the rooms. The program was developed in Unity and C#.

                                <p class="mb-0 pt-2 text-white">I am really proud of how this project went and it is something I would like to integrate into a fully functional game in the future.</p>
